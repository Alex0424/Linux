## GPT - Generative Pre-trained Transformer

- Dev by OpenAI to power ChatGPT and other generative AI apps
- Language Language Model (LLM)
    - based on Transformer deep learning architecture

## SLM - Small Language Model

- Smaller version of LLM
    - fewer parameters

## HLM - Hybrid Language Model

?

## LAM - Large Action Model

- Agentic AI
    - AI that can perform multiple tasks autonomously
- Built on top of LLMs
    - Uses LLM to understand and generate human-like text

## LRM - Large Reasoning Model

- AI model designed to perform complex reasoning tasks
    - breaking down problems into smaller steps (resoning traces)

## VLM - Vision-Language Model

- Capable of understanding and processing video, image, text.

## MoE - Mixture of Experts

- Devides AI model into separate sub networks (smaller sub-models ("experts"))

## LCM - Latent Consistency Model

- Generative AI model for creating images
- Focuses on maintaining consistency in generated images
